Hey @Charan - In comparison to the last design, here’s what’s changed:
Unbolded all text (except some places that are indicated)
Box shape and color are different (all white boxes)
Thinner box outline
Lighter gray box outline (A6A6A6)
Changed from “last week’s emissions” to “last 3 months” - simply take month calc and multiply by 3
Different emojis (uploaded to assets folder)

Hey @Charan - Thanks for all the work getting the calculator up and running! I have a few additional comments from Dane below. Let me know if any of these will be a problem:
Last screen: The ? icon currently does not let you click into the link. It disappears before you can click it
Really think we need to make the boxes rounded edges like Wren vs boxy
You shouldn’t have to click next to advance. Once the “accepted number of answers” is met, it should advance like Wrens’
If not, then Next should be clicked when “Enter” is hit
I kinda also don’t think Last Week’s emissions are relevant. Think might make more sense to do Last 3 months
